## SaaS Offer background
If you are here and wondering what this sample is all about, please continue to read otherwise feel free to skip and continue to the next section. The intended audience for this sample is a **Company(Independent Software Vendor/Publisher)** who ideally have or going to have a [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/) and want to sell it to their customers. 
One of the cloud selling markets to sell a [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/) is [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/) and you can use Azure Marketplace store front to sell your SaaS application to your customers.

When you are selling your SaaS on Azure Marketplace, Microsoft helps deal with the transactions. [Benefits of selling through Commercial Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide#commercial-marketplace-benefits). 

To sell anything on Azure Marketplace you would need to create an offer in [Partner Center](http://partner.microsoft.com/)/[Partner Portal](http://cloudpartner.azure.com/) and publish to Azure marketplace.

There are [many types of offers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type) you can create, publish and sell on Azure Marketplace and SaaS offering happens to be one of them.

    - Put your offer in Azure Marketplace
    - Customer buys the offer 
    - Microsoft bills the customer as per the selected billing term by customer
    - Microsoft pays out to the Company/ISV


2. Marketing and Plan/Pricing model 
    - You will need to provide information to go on your offer page. This includes descirption, support links, logos, screenshots and videos. There are few options on how you would want to sell your offer by creating different plans eg. 
        - flat rate + monthly/yearly + (optional meter_billing or 30 day free trial)
        - per user + monthly/yearly + (optional 30 day free trial)
